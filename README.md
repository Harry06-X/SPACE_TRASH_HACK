The MMR is a modular, zero-waste system crucial for Mars autonomy, managing 12,600 kg of waste. It features 3 closed-loop modules: Polymers yield 3D-filaments/syngas; Metals recycle; Aggregates form Geopolymer for radiation shielding (ISRU). Automated for >95% water recovery and 20-30% energy savings, the MMR is an MVP for base resilience.
